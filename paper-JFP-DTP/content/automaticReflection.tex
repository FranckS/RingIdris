\section{Automatic reflection}

$reflect : \{n:Nat\} \rightarrow (gamma : Vect\ n\ c) \rightarrow (c1:c) \rightarrow Expr\ gamma\ c1$.
The reflected term is guaranteed to be a faithful representation of the input $c1$. We can write this function because Idris has a $\%syntax$ command which let us do pattern maching on syntax (ie, it let us access the AST of a term), and this $\%syntax$ produces functions which are typed ! (unlike Coq's $Ltac$).
