TO DO ON THE PAPER :


- In section 4, I have to finish the some explanations about the various reduce functions :
    . In section 4.3 : for Monoid, how I encode negations (less than half a page)
    . Writing section 4.4 about Commutative groups (a third of a page)
    . In section 4.5 for Ring, how I do the normalization AND how I encode products (a page)
    . For all of the presented structures, I should certainly give a mathematical expression that shows how the normal form looks like for this algebraic structure (a few lines to add)

- In section 6 - Discussion
    . In section 5.2.2 : Mentioning performances when I compare our implementation to Coq (a few lines)
    . In section 5.3.2 : Finishing the part about completeness (Just roughly 5 lines missing)
