TO DO ON THE PAPER :

- In section 2, giving brief idea of the automatic reflection of terms in section 2.5 (still a few lines to write)

- In section 3
	. Finishing to change (=) into (~=) everywhere, after the introduction of the type class Set,
	as I have now directly explained that we will prove equivalences in general, and not only equalities.
	. In section 3.5, Automatic reflection of terms to show for the real problem, certainly for Ring

- In section 4, I have to finish the explanations about the various reduce functions
    .In section 4.3 : for Monoid, how I encode negations (half a page)
    .Writing section 4.4 about Commutative groups (a third of a page)
    .In section 4.5 for Ring, how I do the normalisation AND how I encode products (a page)
    .For all of the presented structures, I should certainly give a mathematical expression that shows how the normal form looks like for this algebraic structure (a few lines to add)

- In section 5, the discussion
    .In section 5.2.2 : Mentionning performances when I compare our implementation to Coq (a few lines)
    .In section 5.3.2 : Finishing the part about completeness (a few lines)
