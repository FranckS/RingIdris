\section{Testing the predicate by automatic generation of terms}

\label{sect:testingInside}


It is often easier to generate examples of something than it is to precisely define it. Thus, we will define a function that is supposed to generate all the lists that we know sorted, according to our informal knowledge of what being sorted is.
 



in order to ensure that the predicate captures the notion that we want for \emph{any} term, we write a function that will 




- it is often easier to generate things rather than to characterise them

- New : a very nice aspect is that we can now automatically generate \emph{all} the terms that satisfy the predicate. it is therefore possible to see some speciffic terms and to check weather they should have been captures or not.

- testing the structural properties by automatic generation of the terms that should satisfy them, and running a decision procedure on them.

- Going a step further : ``test automation by proof", which automatises all of them at once, by doing (another) formal proof, which shows that there is equivalence between all the terms generated and the original predicate that we wanted to certify correct according to the original specification.
